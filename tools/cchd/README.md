# CCH CCD Integration Samples

The `merch-card` web component includes various slots for placing content such as title, price, CTA (Call to Action), etc. The CTA itself is not generated by the `merch-card` but must be provided externally. 

In Milo pages, the `checkout-link` web component is styled as a CTA. However, outside of Milo pages, either the `checkout-link` must be styled by the CCH/CCD teams, possibly using Spectrum CSS, or a `sp-button` from Spectrum Web Components can be used.

The `tools/cchd/index.html` file contains the following examples. Over time, this page will be updated with new examples representing different use cases.

## 1. Milo Consonant CTA styles for the CTA

The checkout link in the footer slot is styled by Milo:
```html
<a is="checkout-link" href="#" class="con-button blue active" data-wcs-osi="Mutn1LYoGojkrcMdCLO7LQlx1FyTHw27ETsfLv0h8DQ">Save now</a>
```

## 2. Spectrum Web Components Styles for the CTA

The checkout link in the footer slot is hidden, and instead, a Spectrum Web Components button is used to handle the click, which triggers the click on the hidden `checkout-link`.

## 3. Odin as Data Source (WIP)

In progress.
