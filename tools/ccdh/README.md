# CCD CCH Integration samples

`merch-card` web component has different slots for placing content such as title, price, cta etc...<br>
The cta itself is not generated by `merch-card` but must be provided externally.<br>
In Milo pages, the web component `checkout-link` is styles as CTA.<br>
However, outside Milo pages, either `checkout-link` must be styled by CCD/CCH teams, maybe using Spectrum CSS, or use a sp-button from Spectrum Web Components.<br>


`tools/ccdh/index.html` contains the following examples.<br>
Over time, this page will be added new examples representing different use cases.

##1. With Milo Consonant CTA styles##

The checkout link in the footer slot is displayed and styled by Milo
```
<a is="checkout-link" href="#" class="con-button blue active" data-wcs-osi="Mutn1LYoGojkrcMdCLO7LQlx1FyTHw27ETsfLv0h8DQ">Save now</a>
```

##2. With Spectrum Web Components Styles##
The checkout link in the footer slot is hidden, and instead a Spectrum Web Components button is used to handle the click, that triggers the click on the hidden `checkout-link`.


##3. With Odin as data source##
In progres.
